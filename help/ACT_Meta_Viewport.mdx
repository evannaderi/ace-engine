### Check that the meta element retains the user agent ability to zoom.

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Page should retain the user agent ability to zoom

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

This rule is designed specifically for 1.4.4 Resize text, which requires that text can be resized up to 200%. Because text that can not be resized up to 200% can not fit in an area of 320 by 256 CSS pixels, this rule maps to 1.4.10 Reflow as well. All passed examples in this rule satisfy both success criteria.


<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

For each test target, the content attribute, whose value is mapped to a list of property/value pairs in a user-agent specific manner, does not:

#### specify the property user-scalable with a value of no; nor
#### specify the property maximum-scale with a value of less than 2.
