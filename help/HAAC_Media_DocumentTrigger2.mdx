## Who does this affect?

 * Blind people using screen readers
 * People who physically cannot use a pointing device

## Why is this important?

If a file download mechanism moves the keyboard focus away from the web page (e.g., when a dialog box is part of the mechanism), it may inadvertently trap keyboard-only users in the UI used to download files. When the dialog is closed, if keyboard focus is not returned to the users' original point of regard, the keyboard-only user may have to spend significant effort navigating back to where they were on the page.

## Check that file download mechanism does not cause keyboard trap
File download mechanism should be keyboard-operable and preserve page focus location

## What to do

 * Manually test by using the tab key to enter and exit the file download mechanism;
 * AND, when exiting the download mechanism, ensure the keyboard focus returns to the same point on the web page where the download was initiated.
