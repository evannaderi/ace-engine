## Who does this affect?

* Blind people using screen readers
* People who physically cannot use a pointing device
* People with tremor or other movement disorders

## Why is this important?

Unlike native HTML form elements, browsers do not provide keyboard support for graphical user interface (GUI) components that are made accessible with ARIA - authors must incorporate the code for keyboard access.

<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

<div id="locLevel" className="level-violation">Violation</div>

## The component does not have a tabbable element
The component must have at least one tabbable element

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

## What to do

* Use the HTML tabindex attribute to include the component in the tab sequence. (Refer to the [WAI-ARIA Authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#keyboard) for more information on how to manage keyboard focus.)
