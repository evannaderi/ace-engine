### A `"group"` or `<fieldset>` does not have an accessible name or has a duplicate name

<!-- This active message title is NOT used by the Checker, the browser extension uses the active messages: Fail_ or Potential_ message in ...nls/index.ts file instead -->


<div id="locLevel"></div>

<!-- the Checker browser extension displays the rule level, such as Violation, Needs Review, or Recommendation here -->

  
Multiple `<fieldset>` and `role="group"` with nested `<inputs>` elements must have unique accessible names (labels) 

<!-- Checker does not display this passive message sub-title, the browser extension displays the 0: message in  ...nls/index.ts file -->

<!-- Note that the messages in the test files must also match the messages from the ...nls/index.ts file instead of message titles here in mdx -->

### Why is this important?

A label associated with a group of inputs also serves as a common label for individual inputs in the group. 
Assistive technologies can indicate the start and end of the group and the group’s label as the user navigates into and out of the group. 
When there are multiple groups with the same inputs then the label of the group needs to be unique so it can be distinguished.  

For example, two groups of inputs for _Name, Address, City, and Zip_ need to be distinquished from one another 
by labelling one group "_**Mailing address**_" and the other "_**Shipping address**_".   

<div id="locSnippet"></div>


### What to do

* Provide a unique label for groups of form controls using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements
* Distinguish multiple `role="group"` elements with a unique 'aria-labelledby' or 'aria-label'
* For a group of radio buttons, use `role="radiogroup"` instead of `role="group"`
