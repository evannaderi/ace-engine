<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

 * Verify that the audio content is also available in text form;
 * OR, provide a transcript of the audio.

For example, a link to an audio file containing a speech would be followed by a link to a page with a transcript:

<CodeSnippet type="multi" light={true}>    Jeremy Flint's &lt;a href="bc30.wav"&gt;podcast on disability rights&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="bc30.txt"&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;)</CodeSnippet>

</Column>
</Row>
