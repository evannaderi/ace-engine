### This is the place to have the rule title, it will show up in reports but the Checker does not display this message title, and tokens cannot be used in mdx

This is the passive message the will show up in reports but the Checker does not display this message sub-title, and backticks can be used here in mdx

### Why is this important?

PLACEHOLDER TEXT HERE SHOULD BE REPLACED BEFORE MERGE TO MASTER ... such as this example test with `role="combobox"`, an `<element>` with values of `"listbox"`, `"tree"`, `"grid"`, or `"dialog"`.
If the value for the `'aria-haspopup'` attribute does not match the value for the popup element's `'role'` 
attribute, people who use assistive technologies may see unexpected behavior and will not know how 
to interact with the content.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* PLACEHOLDER TEXT HERE SHOULD BE REPLACED BEFORE MERGE TO MASTER ... such as Set the value of the `'aria-haspopup'` attribute of the `<combobox>` element to match the value of the `'role'` attribute of the implemented popup.
* Allowed `<popup>` element `'role'` attribute values are `"listbox"`, `"tree"`, `"grid"`, or `"dialog"`.
* **Or**, and another explanation of what to do.

Alert: MORE TEXT HERE IF APPROPRIATE. The recommended code example is:

<CodeSnippet type="multi" light={true}> &lt;label for="tag_combo"&gt;Tag&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" id="tag_combo"
      role="combobox" aria-autocomplete="list"
      aria-haspopup="listbox" aria-expanded="true"
      aria-controls="popup_listbox" aria-activedescendant="selected_option"&gt;
   &lt;ul role="listbox" id="popup_listbox"&gt;
      &lt;li role="option"&gt;Zebra&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li role="option" id="selected_option"&gt;Zoom&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;</CodeSnippet>
