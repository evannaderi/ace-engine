### Verify the pointer can hover over the displayed element, not just the trigger

<!-- This active message title is NOT used by the Checker, 
the browser extension uses the active messages: Fail_ or Potential_ message in ...nls/index.ts file instead -->


<div id="locLevel"></div>

<!-- the Checker browser extension displays the rule level, such as Violation, Needs Review, or Recommendation here -->

The pointer should be able to move over content displayed on hover

<!-- Checker does not display this message sub-title, 
the browser extension displays the 0: message in  ...nls/index.ts file -->

<!-- Note that the messages in the test files must also match 
the messages from the ...nls/index.ts file instead of message titles here in mdx -->

### Why is this important?

When content displays on hover, the pointer should be able to move from the trigger to the new content. If the new content disappears when the pointer leaves the trigger element, users who significantly magnify their screen will never be able to bring the new content into view to read.


<div id="locSnippet"></div>


### What to do

* If using the css `'hover'` pseudo-class on one element in order to set a `'display'` style on another element, the displayed element must be a child of the trigger element;
* **Or**, the newly displayed element must be the adjacent sibling of the trigger, with no `margin` property set on the displayed element (since the margin separates the two elements and prevents the hover display from persisting).

Note: Use of the `~` selector with the `display` style attribute can allow many siblings of the trigger element to be displayed on hover; however, only its adjacent sibling will persistently display when the pointer is moved from the trigger towards the displayed content. 


The recommended code example is:

<CodeSnippet type="multi" light={true}>
 &lt;style&gt;
div {
  background-color: yellow;
  padding: 20px;
  display: none;
}
span:hover div {
  display: block;
}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Hover over me2!&lt;div&gt;I will show on hover, and you can move the pointer over me&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
</CodeSnippet>
