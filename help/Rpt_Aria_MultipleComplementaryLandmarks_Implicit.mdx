## Who does this affect?

* Blind people and people with low vision using screen readers

## Why is this important?

When there are multiple elements with a `"complementary"` role, they must have unique labels that clearly describe the region's content. This includes `<aside>` elements, which have the implicit role of `"complementary"`. These labels help people using assistive technologies to quickly find and navigate to each region.

<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

<div className="level-violation">
Violation
</div>

## Multiple elements with the `"complementary"` role do not have a unique label
All elements with the `"complementary"` role must have a unique label

<div id="elementLocation">
</div>

## What to do

* For each element with a `"complementary"` role, either set the value of the `aria-labelledby` attribute to the `id` of any visible text that appropriately and uniquely describes that region's content;
* OR, use the `aria-label` attribute to add an invisible, unique, non-empty label to each element with the `"complementary"` role.

For example:
```
<h2 id="weather">Weather portlet</h2>
<div role="complementary" aria-labelledby="weather">
   ...
</div>

<div role="complementary" aria-label="Stock ticker portlet">
   ...
</div>
```

</Row>
