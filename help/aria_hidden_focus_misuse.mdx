### Element \“{0}\” should not be focusable within the subtree of an element with an ‘aria-hidden’ attribute with value ‘true’

<div id="locLevel"></div>

Element with aria-hidden should not have focusable content

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

This rule checks that elements with an aria-hidden attribute do not contain focusable elements.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

* None of the target elements are part of sequential focus navigation, nor do they have descendants in the flat tree that are part of sequential focus navigation.

</Column>
<Column colLg={5} colMd={3} colSm={4} className="toolLeft">

### About this requirement
 * By adding aria-hidden="true" to an element, content authors ensure that assistive technologies will ignore the element. This can be used to hide parts of a web page that are pure decoration, such as icon fonts - that are not meant to be read by assistive technologies.

* A focusable element with aria-hidden="true" is ignored as part of the reading order, but still part of the focus order, making its state of visible or hidden unclear.

### Who does this affect?

* People using a screen reader, including blind, low vision and neurodivergent people

</Column>

<Column colLg={5} colMd={3} colSm={4} className="toolLeft">

### Example

* In the following example, the 'buttom' element is focusable by default. Therefore, it violates the rule. Note: Using aria-hidden="false" on a descendant of an element with aria-hidden="true" does not expose that element. aria-hidden="true" hides itself and all its content from assistive technologies.
    
        <div aria-hidden="true">
            <div aria-hidden="false">
                <button>Some button</button>
            </div>
        </div>
    
</Column>
</Row>
</div>

export default ({ children, _frontmatter }) => (<React.Fragment>{children}</React.Fragment>)
