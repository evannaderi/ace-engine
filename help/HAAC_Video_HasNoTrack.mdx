### Why is this important?

Text tracks or open captions contain a textual transcription of audio (captions) aspects of video  content in a synchronized media. This may include the dialog, sound effects, and relevant musical cues. Providing text alternatives makes information available that some people would not have access to otherwise.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

<<<<<<< HEAD
* If the video has any meaningful audio and no captions, then provide closed captions using the '<tracks>' element;
* OR make sure the video has live captions, usually done by professional real-time captioners (also called Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) providers).
=======
* Use the `<track>` element with the `kind` attribute to provide text tracks for the audio (`kind="captions"`) and visual (`kind="descriptions"`) aspects of the video;
* OR make sure the video has open captions, usually done by professional real-time captioners (also called Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) providers);
* OR, if the video has no audio then visual description is needed but captions are not.

For example:

<CodeSnippet type="multi" light={true}>&lt;video src="..."&gt;
      &lt;track src="myvideo.srt" kind="captions" &gt;
&lt;/video&gt;</CodeSnippet>
