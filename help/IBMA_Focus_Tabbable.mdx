import "../../../styles/ToolHelp.scss"
import { CodeSnippet, Tag } from "carbon-components-react";

<div className="toolHelp">
<Row>
<Column colLg={16} colMd={8} colSm={4} className="toolHead">

### The component does not have a tabbable element

<div id="locLevel"></div>

The component must have at least one tabbable element

</Column>
</Row>
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

### Why is this important?

Unlike native HTML form elements, browsers do not provide keyboard support for graphical user interface (GUI) components that are made accessible with ARIA - authors must incorporate the code for keyboard access.

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

Use the HTML tabindex attribute to include the component in the tab sequence.  (Refer to the [WAI-ARIA Authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#keyboard) for more information on how to manage keyboard focus.)

<Column colLg={5} colMd={3} colSm={4} className="toolLeft">
