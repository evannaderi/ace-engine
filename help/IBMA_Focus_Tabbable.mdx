import "../../../styles/ToolHelp.scss"
import { CodeSnippet, Tag } from "carbon-components-react";

<div className="toolHelp">
<Row>
<Column colLg={11} colMd={5} colSm={4} className="toolMain">

<div id="locLevel"></div>

### The component does not have a tabbable element
The component must have at least one tabbable element

[IBM 1.1.1 Non-text content]() | [WCAG technique H37]()

<div id="locSnippet"></div>

### What to do

Use the HTML tabindex attribute to include the component in the tab sequence.  (Refer to the [WAI-ARIA Authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#keyboard) for more information on how to manage keyboard focus.)


</Column>
<Column colLg={5} colMd={3} colSm={4} className="toolLeft">

### Who does this affect?

* Blind people using screen readers
* People who physically cannot use a pointing device
* People with tremor or other movement disorders

### Why is this important?

Unlike native HTML form elements, browsers do not provide keyboard support for graphical user interface (GUI) components that are made accessible with ARIA - authors must incorporate the code for keyboard access.
