### Attributes or elements are deprecated

<!-- This active message title is NOT used by the Checker, 
the browser extension uses the active messages: Fail_ or Potential_ message in ...nls/index.ts file instead -->


<div id="locLevel"></div>

<!-- the Checker browser extension displays the rule level, such as Violation, Needs Review, or Recommendation here -->

Avoid use of obsolete features if possible

<!-- Checker does not display this message sub-title, 
the browser extension displays the 0: message in  ...nls/index.ts file -->

<!-- Note that the messages in the test files must also match 
the messages from the ...nls/index.ts file instead of message titles here in mdx -->

### Why is this important?

When specifications are updated, some elements and attributes become outdated. These deprecated features may become obsolete and be removed in future versions, and should not be used in new projects. As well, a deprecated feature is usually replaced by an improvement in the newer specification, so it wise to update code to avoid deprecated features. Existing projects that use deprecated features should work, since browsers should continue to support them.

### What to do

Replace deprecated elements and attributes with those preferred in the current version of the specification.
